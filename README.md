# SQSH
SQSH (pronounced 'skwish') is a project aimed at providing SSH functionality using QUIC to benefit from multiple streams.

SQSH leverages the cloudflare implementation of quiche (https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche), a QUIC implementation written in rust to provide QUIC.

# This project is a proof of concept and is not ready for widespread use.
If you choose to download and test SQSH, feel free to do so, but dont expect it to have feature-parity with SSH.
